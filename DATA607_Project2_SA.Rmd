## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document with Sean Amato's work for the project 2. In this project I will be examining 3 data sets and try to answer three different questions.

1. For the baseball data set, I want to create a table with the total number of home runs for each team year over year.
2. For the weather data set, I want to visualize the wind patterns across islands in the pacific, for the month of September.
3. For the emergency services data set, I want to create a bar chart with the proportion of patients admitted at different levels of severity.  
* * *  

First, I started by importing all the data and a map image (for #2) housed in my github repository.
```{r}
baseball_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samato0624/DATA607/main/Project2_Baseball.csv") # Analyze home runs over time aggregated by team.
weather_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samato0624/DATA607/main/Project2_Weather.csv") # Analyze weather patterns.
ems_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samato0624/DATA607/main/Project2_Weewoo.csv") # Compare EMS admission cases by severity.

map_url <- "https://github.com/samato0624/DATA607/blob/main/Pacific_Islands.png?raw=true"
```

**1. Baseball** 

Step 1.1 First let's clean up the home run data set.  
```{r}
# Ensure all blanks in the team column are filled in using a for loop.
x <- nrow(baseball_df)
for (i in 1:x) {
  if(baseball_df$Team[i] == ""){
    baseball_df$Team[i] <- baseball_df$Team[i -1]
  }
}

# Clean up column names.
colnames(baseball_df) <- c("Team", "Position", "HR_2018", "HR_2019", "HR_2021", "HR_2022", "HR_2023")

# Remove position column, sum up the home runs across each team, and change the year column to just the integers.
baseball_df2 <- baseball_df %>%
  select(c(1,3,4,5,6,7)) %>%
  group_by(Team) %>%
  summarise(`2018` = sum(HR_2018, na.rm = TRUE),
            `2019` = sum(HR_2019, na.rm = TRUE),
            `2021` = sum(HR_2021, na.rm = TRUE),
            `2022` = sum(HR_2022, na.rm = TRUE),
            `2023` = sum(HR_2023, na.rm = TRUE))

# Replace team acronyms with actual team names.
teams <- c("Baltimore Orioles", "Boston Red Sox", "New York Yankees", "Tampa Bay Rays", "Toronto Blue Jays")
y <- nrow(baseball_df2)

for(j in 1:y){
  baseball_df2$Team[j] <- teams[j]
}


```

Step 1.2 Create the data table.
```{r}
datatable(
  data = baseball_df2,  
  options = list(scrollX = TRUE, 
                 autoWidth = FALSE, 
                 pageLength = 5),
  caption = "Total homeruns for 5 MLB teams by year"
)
```
Conclusions: I don't see any notable trends among the MLB teams, but we have no HRs for 2020 due to C-19.

**2. Weather**

Step 2.1 First let's clean up the weather dataset. 
```{r}
#Need country, location, latitude, longitude, timezone, last_updated, temp_f, wind_mph, and wind_degree columns.
weather_df <- weather_df[c("country", "location_name", "latitude", "longitude", "timezone", "last_updated", "wind_mph", "wind_degree")]

weather_df2 <- weather_df %>%
  filter(str_detect(timezone, "Pacific")) %>% # Filter to a subset of islands in the  Pacific Timezone.
  filter(str_detect(last_updated, "^9")) %>% 
  filter(longitude>0) %>% 
  filter(latitude>-30) %>% 
  mutate(wind_radian = wind_degree * pi/180) %>%
  mutate(latitude_end = wind_mph*sin(wind_radian)/2 + latitude) %>% # Calculating ending positions for wind vectors.
  mutate(longitude_end = wind_mph*cos(wind_radian)/2 + longitude)

weather_df2 <- weather_df2[c("country", "latitude", "longitude", "wind_mph", "latitude_end", "longitude_end")] # Removing unnecessary columns.


```

Step 2.2 Plot the data as vectors on a map of the islands in the pacific.
```{r}
g <- ggplot(weather_df2, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = longitude_end, yend = latitude_end, color = wind_mph), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm")),
               size = 0.85) + # Create vectors on the chart.
  geom_text(aes(label = country), vjust = -2.5) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red", name = "wind_mph") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggbackground(g, map_url) # Place my map as a background image in my plot.
```
Conclusions: Via observation alone the Solomon Islands and Micronesia seem to be less windy than all the other countries.
  
**3. Emergency Services**

Step 3.1 First let's clean up the emergency services data set. 
```{r}
ems_df2 <- ems_df %>%
  select(34:43) %>% # Select the appropriate columns and sum the rows.
  summarise(`Non Urgent1` = sum(EMS_VISITS_NON_URGENT_NOT_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Non Urgent admitted` = sum(EMS_VISITS_NON_URGENT_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Urgent1` = sum(EMS_VISITS_URGENT_NOT_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Urgent admitted` = sum(EMS_VISITS_URGENT_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Moderate1` = sum(EMS_VISITS_MODERATE_NOT_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Moderate admitted` = sum(EMS_VISITS_MODERATE_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Severe1` = sum(EMS_VISITS_SEVERE_NOT_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Severe admitted` = sum(EMS_VISITS_SEVERE_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Critical1` = sum(EMS_VISITS_CRITICAL_NOT_adm, na.rm = TRUE),
            `Critical admitted` = sum(EMS_VISITS_CRITICAL_adm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(`Non Urgent` = `Non Urgent admitted`/(`Non Urgent admitted`+`Non Urgent1`)) %>% # Calculate the proportion of hospital admission rates by severity.
  mutate(`Urgent` = `Urgent admitted`/(`Urgent admitted`+`Urgent1`)) %>%
  mutate(`Moderate` = `Moderate admitted`/(`Moderate admitted`+`Moderate1`)) %>%
  mutate(`Severe` = `Severe admitted`/(`Severe admitted`+`Severe1`)) %>%
  mutate(`Critical` = `Critical admitted`/(`Critical admitted`+`Critical1`)) %>%
  select(c(11:15)) # Select the appropriate columns.

ems_df3 <- pivot_longer(
  ems_df2, 
  cols = "Non Urgent":"Urgent":"Moderate":"Severe":"Critical", 
  names_to = "Severity Status", 
  values_to = "Admission Rate"
)

print(ems_df3)
``` 
Step 3.2 Now let's plot the proportion of hospital admission rates by severity.
```{r}
custom_order <- c("Non Urgent", "Urgent", "Moderate", "Severe", "Critical")
ems_df3$`Severity Status` <- factor(ems_df3$`Severity Status`, levels = custom_order)


ggplot(ems_df3, aes(x = `Severity Status`, y = `Admission Rate`)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen")
```
Conclusions: The worse the severity the higher the admission rate.
