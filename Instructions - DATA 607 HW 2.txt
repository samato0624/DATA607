DATA 607 - HW 2 - Sean Amato


Scope:
This document is an aid for helping you to reproduce the steps I took to create a database and connect it to an Rmd file.


Procedures:

1. Download the MySQL Community Server from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.

2. Set up the server with the host as "localhost" and the username as "root".

3. Run HW2_DATA607_SA.sql within your workspace. It will create the database and add a table to it.

4. Within DATA_607_HW_2_SA.Rmd modify line 27 to include the password you used for setting up your local server.

5. Run the RMD file by knitting to HMTL.
