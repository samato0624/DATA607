DATA 607 - HW 2 - Sean Amato


Scope:
This document is an aid for helping you to reproduce the steps I took to create a database and connect it to an Rmd file.


Procedures:

1. Download the MySQL Community Server from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.

2. Set up the server with the host as "localhost" and the username and password found in the .env file.
NOTE: I know providing the .env file defeats the purpose of having one, but it demonstrates one way to provide credentials to a password protected server database.

3. Place the Rmd, SQL, and .env file all in the same working directory.

3. Run HW2_DATA607_SA.sql within your workspace. It will create the database and add a table to it.

4. Run the RMD file by knitting to HMTL.
