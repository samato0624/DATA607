This is an R Markdown document containing Sean Amato's work pertaining to HW #3.


**Exercise 1:** 
```{r}
# First I need to delete row 146 because it represents less than a Bachelor's Degree.
df2 <- df[-146,]

# Now I'm going to create a column and assign a row TRUE or FALSE based on whether it contains any of the following text in the 'Major' column: SCIENCE, OLOGY, COMPUTER, MATH, and ENGINEERING. While this probably isn't a perfect approach, in my opinion it's a very good first pass. I know "Physics" is one major my classifier misses as you can collect data during experiments and run statistical analysis to ensure your data is sound.
df2$Data_or_Stats <- str_detect(df2$Major, "SCIENCE")|str_detect(df2$Major, "OLOGY")|str_detect(df2$Major, "COMPUTER")|str_detect(df2$Major, "MATH")|str_detect(df2$Major, "ENGINEERING")|str_detect(df2$Major, "TECHNO")

# Printing the top 10 rows to show the results
head(df2, 10) |>
  select(Major, Data_or_Stats) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = md("**Data or Stats**"), subtitle = md("Are Data or Stats used in a particular major?")) |>
  cols_width(everything() ~ px(200))
```

**Exercise 2:**
```{r}
# For this problem I copy and pasted the data directly from the homework and put it into "string1", via single quotes, without formatting it.
string1 <- '[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"
[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  
[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    
[13] "olive"        "salal berry"'

# In the following lines I'm removing things that I don't want in my string.
string2 <- str_remove_all(string1, "[0-9]")
string3 <- str_remove_all(string2, "\\[\\]")

# Here I'm extracting my items in quotations and storing them
matches <- str_extract_all(string3, '"([^"]+)"') # This is the most important thing I learned from this exercise.
x <- unlist(matches)
x2 <- str_remove_all(x, "\"")
print(x2)
```

**Exercise 3:**
Describe in words what the following expressions will match:
(.)\1\1 - This expression will find all triplets in a string for any character, i.e. "<aaa> a jja <kkk>l lkds".  
"(.)(.)\\2\\1" - This expression will find any 4 character palindromes, i.e. "b a<baab>ab racecarara <k  k>l <....>".  
(..)\1 - This expression will find any two consecutive sets of two characters, i.e. "b <abab>ab racec<arar>a kkkl lkds".  
"(.).\\1.\\1" - This expression will find a 5 character string where positions 1, 3, & 5 are any of the same character and position 2 & 4 are any characters, i.e. "b ab<a.aba>b race..carara< k i >kl <...g.>".  
"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1" - This expression will find any 3 characters with any characters in between followed by the same 3 initial characters in reverse, i.e. "<abc cba .   I love taco tuesday!   kjn abc . cba> bleh!".

**Exercise 4:** Construct regular expressions to match words that:  
1. Start and end with the same character.  
2. Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)  
3 .Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)  
```{r}
word_list <- c("racecar", "church", "eleven", "taco", "spinning", "retroactive", "ubuntu", "eel", "lyrically")
# 1 
answer1 <- str_view(word_list, "^(.).*\\1$")
print(answer1)
answer2 <- str_view(word_list, "(..).*\\1")
print(answer2)
answer3 <- str_view(word_list, "(.).*\\1.*\\1.*")
print(answer3)
```
