**Initial Research Quesiton:**
Can I predict a games market performance based on itâ€™s genre and how would it compare to other titles (Indie or AAA) in the same genre?

**Loading Libraries:**
```{r}
# Check if the package is already installed
if (!requireNamespace("steamR", quietly = TRUE)) {
  if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
  }
  
  remotes::install_github("drewlake/steamR")
} else {
  cat("The 'steamR' package is already installed.\n")
}
```
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

I know a lot about their preferences as individuals and can say we all have played a lot of good games and have pretty diverse libraries with some overlap.

# This chart is important because it gives us a good idea what tags might make for good predictors. Remember tags can only have a count as large as the sample of games since each game can only have one count of a particular tag. I'm predicting tags that are good predictors will be somewhere in the middle around a count of ~275, because we know if each game had one tag in common it automatically becomes useless in trying to delineate the games by that tag.

# Use the finalized data to create the better model.
logistic_model_2 <- 
  glm(train_set_2$Binary_All_Reviews_Summary ~ ., data = train_set_2[, 8:ncol(train_set_2)], family = binomial)

```
**Section 5: Model Predictions and Conclusions**

  select(Title, Original_Price, All_Reviews_Summary, Binary_All_Reviews_Summary, average_play_time_min, Percent_Positive, prediction)
prediction_test_data$binary_prediction = ifelse(prediction_test_data$prediction >= 80, 1, 0)


# Adding the predicted probability of the games sentiment that is generated from the updated model.
prediction_test_data_2 <- test_set_2 %>%
  mutate(prediction = predict(logistic_model_2, type = "response", newdata = test_set_2)*100) %>%
  select(Title, Original_Price, All_Reviews_Summary, Binary_All_Reviews_Summary, average_play_time_min, Percent_Positive, prediction)
prediction_test_data_2$binary_prediction = ifelse(prediction_test_data_2$prediction >= 80, 1, 0)

# Assess model performance with all parameters found in the initial model.
roc_curve <- roc(prediction_test_data$Binary_All_Reviews_Summary, predict(logistic_model, type = "response", newdata = test_set))
plot(roc_curve, col = "blue", main = "ROC Curve, All Parameters", lwd = 2)
auc_value <- auc(roc_curve)
text(0.7, 0.2, paste("AUC =", round(auc_value, 3)), col = "red", cex = 1.2)

# Assess model performance with significant parameters found in the updated model.
roc_curve_2 <- roc(prediction_test_data_2$Binary_All_Reviews_Summary, predict(logistic_model_2, type = "response", newdata = test_set_2))
plot(roc_curve_2, col = "blue", main = "ROC Curve 2, Significant Parameters", lwd = 2)
auc_value_2 <- auc(roc_curve_2)
text(0.7, 0.2, paste("AUC =", round(auc_value_2, 3)), col = "red", cex = 1.2)
```

**Conclusions:** Based on my AUC equal to 0.754 I can say my model is pretty good at determining which games will have 80% or more positive reviews. Below is the criteria used:

0.5 to 0.6: Poor discrimination  
0.6 to 0.7: Fair discrimination  
0.7 to 0.8: Good discrimination  
0.8 to 0.9: Very good discrimination  
0.9 to 1.0: Excellent discrimination  

Looking at the data table towards the bottom of the page we can say the following before making any decisions about recommending game:  
There is a 68.2% chance that a game recommended will be good.  
There is an 8.2% chance that a game not recommended will be bad.
There is a 6.4% chance that a game recommended will be bad
There is a 17.2% chance that a game not recommended will be good.  

The chance you would like a game recommended by the model is 68.2/(68.2+6.4) which is ~91.4%. Although there is a chance of missing out on some good games, by using the model's recommendation to buy a game labeled as "Very Positive" or "Overwelmingly Positive", the likelihood of enjoying the game is approximately 91.4%, surpassing the effectiveness of using aggregate statistics to predict game likability (Steam Data has an overall average of 86.4%).
