## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for Sean Amato's Week 9 homework. In this file I'm acquiring information on NY Times best selling mangas.

```{r}
# A request is sent to the API and the mangas are captured in a list of lists.
df <- request("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3//lists/current/manga.json?api-key=tuDsoGCqUWBAm7z3obdIO46PGoUGECBx") %>%
  req_perform() %>%
  resp_body_string() %>%
  fromJSON()

# The list of lists is converted to a data frame in order to extract the nested list.
df2 <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, df))
nested_df <- df2[5, 11]

# The nested list is converted to a data frame in order to filter to the columns of interest.
df3 <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, nested_df)) %>%
  select(c(1, 11, 12, 9, 8))

# The data frame is displayed as a table.
datatable(
  data = df3,  
  options = list(scrollX = TRUE, 
                 autoWidth = FALSE, 
                 pageLength = 10),
  caption = "NY Times Best Selling Mangas"
)
```
